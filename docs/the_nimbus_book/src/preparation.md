# Prepare for Mainnet


## Latest software

Please check that you are running the latest stable [Nimbus software release](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/releases).

> **Note:** If you are setting up your client before launch, it is your responsibility  to check for any new software releases in the run up to launch. At the minimum you should check the [release page](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/releases) weekly.

## More than 20 peers

Please check that your node has at least 15 peers. See [the footer](keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) at the bottom of the terminal window for your peer count.

## Validator attached

Please check that your [validator is attached](keep-an-eye.md#make-sure-your-validator-is-attached) to your node.

## VPN

To avoid exposing your validator identity to the network, we recommend you use a trustworthy VPN such as [protonmail](https://protonmail.com/).. This help reduce the risk of revealing your IP address to the network.

## Ethereum Foundation's Checklist

Ad a final check, we recommend you also go through the EF'S [staker checklist](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/checklist).
