# Graffiti

You can use your node's graffiti flag to make your mark on history and forever engrave some words of your choice into an Ethereum block. You will be able to see it using the block explorer.

To do so on **Pyrmont**, run:

```
./run-pyrmont-beacon-node.sh --graffiti="<YOUR_WORDS>"
```

To do so on **Mainnet**, run:

```
./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh --graffiti="<YOUR_WORDS>"
```
