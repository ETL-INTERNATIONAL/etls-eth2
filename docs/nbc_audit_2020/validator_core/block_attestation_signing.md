# Description

Verify that cryptographic primitives (Miracl and BLST) are properly used at a high-level.
We assume that they are correctly implemented in the backend. Note, for this phase 2 we are concerned about the proper usage internal to nim-beacon-chain. Phase 3 will be about the end-user API (keystores and secret management).

Specs:
- [https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#bls-signatures](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#bls-signatures)

For information, evaluation of backends: [https://notes.status.im/nim-bls-curve-backends](https://notes.status.im/nim-bls-curve-backends)

(phase 3) ETH2 has 2 kinds of keys
- a signing key which is used by validators to sign attestations or blocks.
The signing key is needed on a permanent basis by the validator client (audit phase 3).
Leaking this key puts the owner at risk of slashing (double-voting)
- a withdrawal key which is used by validators to retrieve their stake (~32 ETH).
The withdrawal key should be generated offline and stored offline.
